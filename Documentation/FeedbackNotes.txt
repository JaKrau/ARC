Notes for Jake
Converting an object to a string, then referencing it as an object.
Doesn't pass arguments to functions.
Doesn't reference the index of the array.
Kept the index of an array within a string.
Passing the incorrect parameters to a method/object functon.

Notes for Mikey
parameters were not entered for function calls.
Doesn't add semicolons to the end of statements.
Uses variables globally that are better used locally.

Overall notes:
A variable represents something that needs to be remembered. Nearly all variables will use nouns or adjectives.
A function represents doing something. Nearly all functions will use verbs.

Functions are a nice way to break down logic from psuedo-code. Start with the high level. Then list in psuedo code what you need to do to achieve that high level. If you see a verb that would require more than 10 lines of code. Make another function. Then list the psuedo code until you dig down to basic syntax. For Instance.
//Display Calender
->//Display Day
  ->//Display Episode

For only working with javascript for a month under this format. It's still impressive what you accomplished without prior coding knowledge. Given the format of the class, it may be helpful to subscribe to a Front-End / Full-stack Developer Channel.
