Notes for Jake

Global var now was converted to a string using the .format method. When it is used later, the dayjs functions will not work.
Global array fiveEpisodeDisplay calls displayEpisode 5 times, but does not pass arguments.
In the displayDay function:
    fiveEpisodeDisplay represents an array, but the index is not referenced.
    The text content will be unformatted as written.
In the displayEpisode function:
    sectionEl represents an array as written, but the index is not referenced when it's used.
    the array indices need to be outside the string quotes.
    .setAttribute takes 2 arguments, and only altars one attribute

Logic behind the display functions.
    displayList() is called
    displayList() has a loop for each day where it calls displayDay(day)
    displayDay(day) has a loop for each episode it calls displayEpisode(day, key) and appends the article to the section for that day
    displayEpisode(day, key) adds an article element for the episode referenced and returns the article element.

Notes for Mikey
parameters were not entered for function calls.
Doesn't add semicolons to the end of statements.
Uses variables globally that are better used locally
